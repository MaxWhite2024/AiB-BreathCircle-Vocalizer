About the Breathing Circle:

The Breathing circle is a UI element that visualizes a breathing rate. By default, this breathing rate is: Breath in for 3 seconds, Hold peak of breath for 1 second, Breath out for 3 seconds, and Hold trough of breath for 1 sec, then repeat indefinitely. This default rate can be changed by going to Assets >> Scripts >> Rhythm_Behavior.cs >> and changing the values of in_time, peak_hold_time, out_time, and trough_hold_time.

These rates can be changed during gameplay via the pause menu. The pause menu can be accessed by pressing “esc” or “p” on the keyboard or pressing the “pause” button in the upper left hand side of the screen. The bindings for triggering a pause can be changed by going to Assets >> Input Folder >> Player_Input_Actions >> Pause >> and deleting or adding new bindings via the input system (Documentation for the Unity input system can be found here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.6/manual/index.html)
